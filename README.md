- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @O1LER, troughout the weekdays i work on industrial PLCs and the stuff they control
- But on the side im interested in general electrics, electronics and arduino
- Recently i took interest in modding for beamNG, beamMP and the different programming languages that get used in there
- So i know generally what and how to programm things coming from industrial PLCs, but im still at the very beginning when it comes to specific, PC-side languages like python or lua

Cheers
